1. Web browsers display a user interfact that you interact with. This is displayed using a "rendering engine" that takes in HTML and CSS documents and displays its interpretation of that data. The "browser engine" is the middleman between the rendering engine, the user interface, and external communication with servers. As for the external servers, the browser has to request the documents, images, and other media from the servers over the network in order for the rendering engine to have what it needs to display the content of the page. For the websites to be functional, Javascript is used. Browsers can't interpret that on their own, so every browser has a Javascript Interpreter in order for it to be usable. Data storage (both local and cookies) are used to keep track of information pertinent to what the website needs from you.
2. DOM (the Document Object Model) is the interface that tells programming languages how a document can be accessed and changed by representing the documents as nodes and objects on a tree structure.
3. HTML is a structured tagging system that is used to render content and page structure. XML does not display anything, it just tags things (but you have to structure the tags individually). XHTML is more like HTML than XML, but it acts as a bridge between the two. Harder to write though.
4. You need the "<!DOCTYPE>" "<root>" "<head>" and "<body>" elements.
5. index.html is the master HTML file for a website, most often the homepage. it goes in the top-most level of the directory
6. best naming practices include: you cannot use spaces (instead use underscores "my_webpage", or dashes "my-webpage"). it is not recommended to start file names with numerics. also, capitalization matters so be consistent. another thing is to not use funky characters (& ? # etc). include an extension with all of the files.
