        <p>Sometimes, when I'm really upset about something, I think about my father.</p>
        <p>
            I think a lot of people probably do. Queer people especially. I was not uniquely mistreated, maligned, or any other "m" word that may be malicious in child-rearing. I was, however, the son of an alcoholic.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are not the child of an alcoholic, I don't recommend you try to get your parent(s) to start drinking on my account. Back to what I was saying. When I get upset, I think of my father. His name is Eric, he is going to be 53 this year, and I haven't seen him willingly in almost four years.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>I am inviting him to my wedding in the summer.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't know what made me invite him. Maybe it's because he's getting older. Maybe it's because I only plan to get married this one time and I want my dad to be there for that. Maybe I'm secretly hoping he'll cause a scene and I'll have a legitimate reason to cut him out of my life for good. Maybe I hope, even more secretly, that he'll pull through and be there for me,<span style="text-decoration-line: line-through;">because he never has been before.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is his last chance. <span id="goodbye">I hope that he gets it right.</span>
