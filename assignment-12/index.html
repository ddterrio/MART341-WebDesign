    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>Starting us off at #14 is "Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl". I'm gonna be real here: I don't hate this song, but something has to be in last place. Unfortunately, in an album filled with absolute bangers like this one, SGUMG just isn't the same caliber as the other tracks. It goes for a club kid RuPaul beat and ends up with a knock off Paris Hilton beat at best. Pass.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#13 we have "Guilty Pleasure". I feel nothing particularly strong about this song, and that's fine! I like it for what it is, which is Roan's take on an 80's teen pop love ballad (or at least, that's my take on it). Where it falls short is that it is ultimately forgettable.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#12 is "Picture You". This feels like Roan's homage to the likes of Lana Del Rey or Marina and the Diamonds. This slow song has its place on the album, and it makes sense that it is in the later half of the album due to the lower energy.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#11 is "Kaleidoscope". I don't particularly love this song, but the lyrics "But ever since that day / Everything has changed / The way I write your name / The cursive letter A" really gets me. The emotional detail and delivery of that line is exquisite.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#10 is "Coffee". This one really hurts. If I were to re-rank this album in a year, I think this song would be in the top 3, or at least the top 5. I am just in a good spot right now, so I do not want to dwell on the raw emotional pain that Roan is displaying here.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#9 is "After Midnight". This is a bisexual anthem. While I normally find ambiguity in love songs annoying, Roan captures the fluidity and frenetic energy of a club in the middle of the night during a rave, when everyone is dancing and feeling good. Great song.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#8 is "California". This song is so different from <em>almost</em> every song on the album. The only one that comes close is "Pink Pony Club", which this song is a response to. It comes two songs after "Pink Pony Club" and its lyrics are the aftermath of questions asked in that song. "Thought I'd be cool in California / I'd make you proud / To think I almost had it going / But I let you down". Incredible storytelling. </p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#7 is "Red Wine Supernova". I used to love this song a lot. It was my favorite on the album, but as I've listened to it more and more, I think it is just fine. It plays on the concept of a call and response, which is always fun, and you can hear how much fun Roan is having when she is singing.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#6 is "Naked in Manhattan". The reason this song is so high is for two reasons: 1. it references Mulholland Drive and that is one of my favorite movies; 2. the prechorus and chorus are so catchy that I find myself muttering them sometimes without thinking about it. I also love the concept of homoeroticism in friendship and skirting that line between friendship and something more.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#5 is "My Kink is Karma". Vengence is such a sweet emotion, and cosmic justice is so much sweeter when you don't have to do anything. Roan manages to capture the near-euphoric feeling that you get when someone who has wronged you gets what is coming to them. Absolutely no notes.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#4 is "HOT TO GO!". You can tell that Roan was in cheer, or at least friends with a lot of people who were. She is unabashedly forward with her sexuality and desire, up to and including in the song title; she proudly proclaims that she is, indeed, "hot to go!" and that "no one has touched me there in a damn hot minute!". This is a catchy power anthem that will be around for a long time.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#3 is "Femininomenon". This song challenges you to listen to it. It is the first song on the album and it is the litmus test for whether or not you deserve to listen to Roan open herself to you in the rest of the album. It is annoying and loud and disruptive, making references to late 2000's/early 2010's pop like Ke$ha with random bursts of talking interspersed with loud choruses. It is so good.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#2 is "Pink Pony Club". I spoke before in "California" about this song a bit. The stakes in this song are Roan leaving her home town to live in West Hollywood. She works at the "Pink Pony Club", a gay bar that she can dance at and practice her art; her mother doesn't approve, Roan singing "Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene / She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream / God, what have you done? You're a pink pony girl / And you dance at the club". I love this song so much. It is nearly perfect in my eyes.</p>
    </div> </br>
    <div class="child-container overflow-y">
        <p>#1 is, of course, "Casual". This track is perfect. Roan is at her most emotionally raw here, to the point where it feels almost voyeuristic to listen to. This song goes beyond a sad love song and into the realm of a full lament; it is crude and brutally honest and it <em>hurts</em> even if you've never experienced something similar.</p>
