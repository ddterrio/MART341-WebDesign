        <h1>Lyrics</h1>
        <p>This is for the lions living in the wiry, broke-down frame of my friends' bodies<br />
        When the floodwater comes, it ain't gonna be clear; it's gonna look like mud<br />
        But I will help you swim<br />
        I will help you swim, I'm gonna help you swim
        </p>
        <p>This is for the snakes and the people they bite<br />
        For the friends I've made, for the sleepless nights<br />
        For the warning signs I've completely ignored<br />
        There's an amount to take, reasons to take more<br />
        It's no big surprise you turned out this way<br />
        When they closed their eyes and prayed you would change<br />
        And they cut your hair and sent you away<br />
        You stopped by my house the night you escaped<br />
        With tears in my eyes, I begged you to stay<br />
        You said "Hey, man, I love you, but no fucking way"
        </p>
        <p>I'm sure that we could find something for you to do on stage<br />
        Maybe shake a tambourine, or when I sing, you sing harmonies<br />
        </p>
        <p>This is for the lake that me and my friends swim in<br />
        Naked and dumb on a drunken night<br />
        And it should have felt good, but I could hear the <i>Jaws</i> theme song<br />
        On repeat in the back of my mind<br />
        Make sure to kiss your knuckles before you punch me in the face<br />
        There are lessons to be learned, and consequences for all the stupid things I say<br />
        And it is no big surprise that you turned out this way<br />
        The spark in you eyes, the look on you face<br />
        I will not be brave
        </p>
        <!--Jesus Horatio Christ "I will not be brave" just shoot me next time. It would hurt less-->
        <p>I'm sure that we could find something for you to do on stage<br />
        Maybe shake a tambourine, or when I sing, you sing harmonies<br />
        </p>
        <p>I wanna contribute to the chaos<br />
        I don't wanna watch and then complain<br />
        'Cause I am through finding blame<br />
        That is a decision that I have made
        </p>
        <p>She hopes I'm cursed forever<br />
        To sleep on a twin-size mattress<br />
        In somebody's attic or basement my whole life<br />
        Never graduating in size to add another<br />
        And my nightmares will have nightmares every night<br />
        Oh, every night, every night
        </p>
